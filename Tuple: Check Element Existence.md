# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

x = ('a','b','c','n','e','s','t',1,4,2,6,3,12,54)
if ('n' in x):
    print("The letter 'n' is present in the tuple")
else:
    print("The letter 'n' is not present in the tuple")
if(8 in x):
    print("The number 8 is present in the tuple")
else:
    print("The number 8 is not present in the tuple")
```
